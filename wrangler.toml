# Wrangler configuration for deploying the shawnyxx portfolio to Cloudflare
# Replace placeholders (ACCOUNT_ID, ZONE_ID, and route) with your Cloudflare values.
# This file is set up to deploy the built Vite output (dist/) as a Workers Sites / static site.

name = "shawnyxx"
account_id = "4f46d6f7ba477db50fecadf4cfa7a297"
compatibility_date = "2026-01-31"
type = "vite"
workers_dev = true

# If you want to publish to a custom domain using a route, set these values.
# Example:
# route = "example.com/*"
# zone_id = "REPLACE_WITH_ZONE_ID"

[build]
command = "npm run build"

# This tells Wrangler which folder to upload as the site static assets.
[site]
bucket = "dist"
entry-point = "workers-site"

[env.production]
# Uncomment and fill these values to publish to your domain when running:
# wrangler publish --env production
#route = "example.com/*"
#zone_id = "REPLACE_WITH_ZONE_ID"

# Notes:
# - This file will work for deploying static sites via Workers Sites. For Cloudflare Pages
#   you can instead connect the repo via the Pages UI (recommended for static sites) and
#   use `npm run build` with `dist/` as the output directory.
# - To use Wrangler locally, install it: `npm install -g wrangler` (or use `npm run` scripts)
#   then authenticate: `wrangler login` and publish with `wrangler publish`.
